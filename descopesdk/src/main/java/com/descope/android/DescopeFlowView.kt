/**
 * Authenticate a user using Descope Flows.
 *
 * Embed this view into your UI to be able to run flows built with the
 * [Descope Flow builder](https://app.descope.com/flows)
 *
 * **Setup**
 *
 * - As a prerequisite, the flow itself must be defined and hosted.
 * It's possible to use Descope's auth hosting solution, or host it
 * yourself. Read more [here.](https://docs.descope.com/auth-hosting-app)
 *
 * - To use the Descope authentication methods, it is required
 * to configure the desired authentication methods in the [Descope console.](https://app.descope.com/settings/authentication)
 * Some of the default configurations might be OK to start out with,
 * but it is likely that modifications will be required before release.
 *
 *    - **IMPORTANT NOTE**: even the Application links are the recommended way to configure
 *      deep links, some browsers, such as Opera, do not honor them and open the URLs inline.
 *      It is possible to circumvent this issue by using a custom scheme, albeit less secure.
 *
 * - Beyond that, in order to use navigation / redirection based authentication,
 * namely `Magic Link`, `OAuth (social)` and SSO, it's required to set up app links.
 * App Links allow the application to receive navigation to specific URLs,
 * instead of opening the browser. Follow the [Android official documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links)
 * to set up App link in your application.
 *
 * - Finally, it is possible for users to authenticate using the Google account or accounts they are logged into
 * on their Android devices. If you haven't already configured your app to support `Sign in with Google` you'll
 * probably need to set up your [Google APIs console project](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/credential-manager-siwg#set-google)
 * for this. You should also configure an OAuth provider for Google in the in the [Descope console](https://app.descope.com/settings/authentication/social),
 * with its `Grant Type` set to `Implicit`. Also note that the `Client ID` and
 * `Client Secret` should be set to the values of your `Web application` OAuth client,
 * rather than those from the `Android` OAuth client.
 * For more details about configuring your app see the [Credential Manager documentation](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/credential-manager).
 *
 * **Usage**
 *
 * Add a [DescopeFlowView] to your UI via XML, compose, or code.
 *
 * Running a flow requires providing an instance of [DescopeFlow] to the [DescopeFlowView].
 * The [DescopeFlow] object defines where and how a flow is run.
 * Read the [DescopeFlow] documentation for a detailed,
 * explanation of the available required and optional configurations.
 *
 *     descopeFlowView.listener = object : DescopeFlowView.Listener {
 *         override fun onReady() {
